##Project Name:Personal Profile Page

##Project Instructions
To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

Create or find an image file to represent yourself and a new image for the background. Be aware of file size: keep the profile image under 400 KB and the background image under 1 MB (see the link in the resources section to Picresize, an online image resizing tool).
###Using a text editor, modify the HTML of the index.html file:
* Add the images you collected in step 1 to the page.
* Personalize the text on the page by changing the name, background and goals. Feel free to make up the information if you do not wish to share anything personal.
* Adding links to your GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. If you don't have a Twitter or LinkedIn account, or don't want to share those, then delete those links.
* Feel free to expand on this project, by adding an additional page or two, adding more images and customizing the CSS.
* If you do not want to add an additional page then delete the experience link in the HTML.

###Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account:
* See the workshop on Using GitHub for the Degree Program (linked in the Additional Resources section). The GitHub Desktop application can automatically create a new repository for you.
* Make sure that you're only putting the files for this project in that repository.

###Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
* Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
* There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
  * Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
  * If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
  * If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.
